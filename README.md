# nerdflirt
Full featured Front-end app using John Papa Styled Angular

Objectives

* Build a single-page CRUD application in Angular using routing, factories / services and $http
* Implement custom-directives
* Implement JWT-based authentication between single-page apps and servers

Project Description

* This project is an opportunity to test out all of your Angular knowledge and act as a frontend developer. The backend team (your instructors) have put together an API for a dating website and you will be designing the frontend.
* We've tried to make this project as "real life" as possible; you may very likely find yourself working with an API developed by another team in your company where the most information you get is documentation. Imagine it's built in a language you don't know!
* Thematically, you may take the project any direction you want: there's enough information to build a number of different sites that are about connecting individuals to one another.
*There is a lot to do in this project and we don't expect you'll get every feature completed. Take a look at the existing stories and mockups and make sensible choices on what to work on. With that said, make sure to focus on completing the Objectives above!

You may test it out by hitting a /ping endpoint for any of the available resources.
